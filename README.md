# floem: Integrating Predictive AI with Water Infrastructure
This is our team's solution to Xylem's 24 Hour Haquathon in November 2022. We were tasked with finding a solution to mitigate the effects of water shortages while increasing water sustainability within the expanding urban landscape of London.

## Summary
We proposed a data-driven solution to integrate the rollout of smart meters across London with AI that could predict potential leaks in water infrastructure before they actually occur. In our proposal, we considered factors such as manpower issues, London's dense urban landscape and financial feasibility. We decided to design a web application that would use the AI in its backend to provide ease of use for water management companies, successfully developing a working prototype of the application in Figma to showcase in our presentation.
